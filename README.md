# Tyson

A small utility to destroy machines in Azure. Azure lacks a native feature to delete a VM and its underlying storage. This makes it impossible to destroy and re-create using ARM templates automatically.

## Binary releases

Pre-compiled versions may be found in the [release section](https://github.com/iamseth/tyson/releases).
